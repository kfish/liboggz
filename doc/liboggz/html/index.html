Oggz makes programming with Ogg easy!</a></h2>
This is the documentation for the Oggz C API. Oggz provides a simple programming interface for reading and writing Ogg files and streams. Ogg is an interleaving data container developed by Monty at <a href="http://www.xiph.org/">Xiph.Org</a>, originally to support the Ogg Vorbis audio format.<p>
liboggz supports the flexibility afforded by the Ogg file format while presenting the following API niceties:<p>
<ul>
<li>Strict adherence to the formatting requirements of Ogg <a class="el" href="group__basics.html">bitstreams </a>, to ensure that only valid bitstreams are generated</li><li>A simple, callback based open/read/close or open/write/close <a class="el" href="oggz_8h.html">interface </a> to raw Ogg files</li><li>A customisable <a class="el" href="group__seek__api.html">seeking </a> abstraction for seeking on multitrack Ogg data</li><li>A packet queue for feeding incoming packets for writing, with callback based notification when this queue is empty</li><li>A handy <a class="el" href="oggz__table_8h.html">table </a> structure for storing information on each logical bitstream</li></ul>
